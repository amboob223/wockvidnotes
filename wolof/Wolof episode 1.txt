Wolof episode 1 
    Location:white screen or my pops house

    Senegalese/Mauritanian Wolof and Gambian Wolof are distinct
     national standards: they use different orthographies and use
      different languages (French vs. English) as their source
       for technical loanwords. However, both the spoken and 
       written languages are mutually intelligible. Lebu Wolof, 
       on the other hand, is incomprehensible with standard Wolof
       , a distinction that has been obscured because all Lebu 
       speakers are bilingual in standard Wolof.[8]
